    "    <p> a) Unemployment did ultimately recover. Using pre-covid UE mean as the baseline for UE, the data shows full recovery was acheived in November, 2021 (1 year 8 months from start). It should be noted that 'recovery' can be calculated many ways and lower UE is not always a healthy indicator. </p></br>\n",
    "        <li>What age groups were most impacted by the pandemic?</li></br>\n",
    "        a) Men and women over age 20 were impacted relatively similarly across the period with average increases in UE being slightly larger for women during the time period. For all groups, UE is now lower than pre-covid. It is noteable that children age 16-19 had the largest peak increase in unemployment (~18.3%), but saw a decrease in unemployment on average as indicated by the negative mean. One possible explanation for this oddity is that more children were seeking employement during covid as parents faced high UE (leading to a larger spike in youth UE by %) and businesses looking to save on wages by hiring less experienced workers (resulting in a faster decline in UE and more employment on average than pre-covid).\n",
